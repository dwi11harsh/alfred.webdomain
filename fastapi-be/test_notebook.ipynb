However, there are several areas where improvements can be made. Here's a critique with actionable feedback:\\n\\n### Missing Dependencies\\n- **React and React Hooks**: Ensure that `react` and `react-dom` are included as dependencies, since they are fundamental for any Next.js project but are not explicitly listed.\\n- **Tailwind CSS**: While the design guidelines mention using Tailwind CSS, its dependency is not mentioned. Add `tailwindcss` along with `postcss` and `autoprefixer` for Tailwind to work.\\n\\n### Component Dependency Issues\\n- **Shared Dependencies**: Both components (`page.tsx` and `TodoItem.tsx`) list `@tabler/icons-react`, but `framer-motion` is only in `page.tsx`.
